# Media Player Menu (Unix Script)

A simple **menu-based media player script** for Unix systems. The script
lists all media files in a directory and allows the user to select and
play any file by entering its option number.

 Features

-   Lists all audio/video files from a folder
-   Simple menu-based interface
-   Plays selected media file
-   Supports common formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.mp4`, `.mkv`, etc.
-   Uses built-in Unix media players

How to Run

1. Clone the repository

```

2. Give execution permission

chmod +x media_player.sh
```

3. Run the script

``` bash
./media_player.sh

How It Works

1.  The script scans the `media/` directory
2.  Displays all media files with option numbers
3.  User selects a file
4.  Script plays it using the installed media player
